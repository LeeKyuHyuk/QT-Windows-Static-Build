    \title Testing QDoc output from .qdoc files
    \brief This is a simple page for testing purposes only.

    QDoc generates documentation for software projects. It does this by
    extracting \e {QDoc comments} from project source files. QDoc comments are
    signified by a C-style-like comment tag followed by an exclamation point,
    like this:
    \beginqdoc \c {This text is contained within QDoc comment tags.} \endqdoc.

    \section1 Supported file types
    QDoc parses \c .cpp and \c .qdoc files. It does extract comments from
    header (\c {.h}) files.

    \section1 Further information
    This test document is written with the purpose of testing the output QDoc
    generates when parsing \c .qdoc files. It is fairly simple and makes use of
    a limited subset of QDoc's command. Those commands are:
    \list
        \li \c {\page}
        \li \c {\title}
        \li \c {\brief}
        \li \c {\e} (for emphasizing "QDoc comments")
        \li \c {\c} (for multiple monospace-formatted entries)
        \li \c {\section1}
        \li \c {\list}
        \li \c {\li}
        \li \c {\endlist}
    \endlist
