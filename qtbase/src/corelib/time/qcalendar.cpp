    \brief The QCalendarBackend class provides basic calendaring functions.

    QCalendarBackend provides the base class on which all calendar types are
    implemented. On construction, the backend is registered with its primary
    name.

    A backend may also be registered with aliases, where the calendar is known
    by several names. Registering with the name used by CLDR (the Unicode
    consortium's Common Locale Data Repository) is recommended, particularly
    when interacting with third-party software. Once a backend is registered for
    a name, QCalendar can be constructed using that name to select the backend.

    Each calendar backend must inherit from QCalendarBackend and implement its
    pure virtual methods. It may also override some other virtual methods, as
    needed.

    Most backends are pure code, with no data elements. Such backends should
    normally be implemented as singletons. For a backend to be added to the
    QCalendar::System \c enum, it should be such a singleton, with a case in
    backendFromEnum()'s switch statement (above) to instantiate it.

    Non-singleton calendar backends should ensure that each instance is created
    with a distinct primary name. Later instances attempting to register with a
    name already in use shall fail to register and be unavailable to QCalendar,
    hence unusable.

    particular system.

    The default QCalendar() is a proleptic Gregorian calendar, which has no year
    zero. Other calendars may be supported by enabling suitable features or
    loading plugins. Calendars supported as features can be constructed by
    passing the QCalendar::System enumeration to the constructor. All supported
    calendars may be constructed by name, once they have been constructed. (Thus
    plugins instantiate their calendar backend to register it.) Built-in
    backends, accessible via QCalendar::System, are also always available by
    name.

    A QCalendar value is immutable.
