    \brief Describes how to use CMake in your development projects.
    \nextpage Get started with CMake

    \c{CMake} is a tool to simplify the build process for development projects across different
    platforms. \c CMake automatically generates build systems, such as Makefiles and Visual Studio
    project files.

    \c{CMake} is a 3rd party tool with its own \l{CMake Documentation}{documentation}. This topic
    describes how to use \c{CMake} 3.1.0 with Qt 5.

    Start with \c{find_package} to locate the libraries and header files shipped with Qt. Then, you
    can use these libraries and header files with the \c{target_link_libraries} command to build
    Qt-based libraries and applications. This command automatically adds the appropriate include
    directories, compile definitions, the position-independent-code flag, and links to the
    \c qtmain.lib library on Windows, for example.

    \section2 Build a GUI executable

    To build a helloworld GUI executable, you need the following:

    \snippet snippets/cmake/examples.cmake 0

    For \c{find_package} to be successful, \c CMake must find the Qt installation in one of the
    following ways:
    \list 1
        \li Set your \c CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH environment variable to the Qt 5 installation prefix.
            This is the recommended way.
        \li Set the \c{Qt5_DIR} in the \c CMake cache to the location of the \c{Qt5Config.cmake}
            file.
    \endlist

    The \c CMAKE_AUTOMOC setting runs moc automatically when required. For more details, see
    \l{CMake AUTOMOC documentation}.

    \section2 Imported targets

    Imported targets are created for each Qt module. In \c{CMake}, commands such as
    \c{target_link_libraries} use imported target names instead of variables like
    \c{Qt5<Module>_LIBRARIES}. The actual path to the library can be obtained using the
    \l{CMake LOCATION Documentation}{LOCATION property}, as follows:

    \snippet snippets/cmake/examples.cmake 1

    However, you rarely need the full location to the library as most \c{CMake} APIs can locate
    imported targets and use them automatically, instead of the full path. For this purpose, each
    module in Qt 5 has a library target with the \b{Qt5::<Module>} naming convention.

    Imported targets are created with the same configurations as when Qt was configured. That is:
    \list
        \li If Qt was configured with the \c -debug switch, an imported target with the DEBUG
            configuration is created.
        \li If Qt was configured with the \c -release switch, an imported target with the RELEASE
            configuration is created.
        \li If Qt was configured with the \c -debug-and-release switch, which is the default on
            Windows, then imported targets are created with both RELEASE and DEBUG configurations.
    \endlist

    If your project has custom \c{CMake} build configurations, you have to map your custom
    configuration to either the debug or the release Qt configuration.

    \snippet snippets/cmake/examples.cmake 2

    In \c{CMake}, plugins are also available as \c IMPORTED targets. The \l{Qt Network}, \l{Qt SQL},
    \l{Qt GUI}, and \l{Qt Widgets} modules have plugins associated. They provide a list of plugins
    in the \c{Qt5}\e{<Module>}\c{_PLUGINS} variable.

    \section1 Module variables

    When you use \c{find_package}, the resulting imported targets are created for use with
    \c{target_link_libraries}. Some variables are populated with information required to configure
    the build. For each module, the name of its imported target matches the name of the module with
    a "Qt5::" prefix, such as "Qt5::Widgets". All of the package-specific variables have a
    consistent name with its package name as prefix.

    For example, \c{find_package(Qt5 COMPONENTS Widgets)}, when successful, makes the following
    variables available:

    \table
        \header
            \li Variable
            \li Description
        \row
            \li \c Qt5Widgets_VERSION
            \li A string that describes the module's version.
        \row
            \li \c Qt5Widgets_LIBRARIES
            \li A list of libraries for use with the \c target_link_libraries command.
        \row
            \li \c Qt5Widgets_INCLUDE_DIRS
            \li A list of directories for use with the \c include_directories command.
        \row
            \li \c Qt5Widgets_DEFINITIONS
            \li A list of definitions for use with the \c add_definitions command.
        \row
            \li \c Qt5Widgets_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
            \li A list of definitions for use with the \c COMPILE_DEFINITIONS target property.
        \row
            \li \c Qt5Widgets_FOUND
            \li A boolean that describes whether the module was found successfully.
        \row
            \li \c Qt5Widgets_EXECUTABLE_COMPILE_FLAGS
            \li A string of flags to use when building executables.
    \endtable

    For all packages found with \c{find_package}, equivalents of these variables are available;
    they are case-sensitive.

    \section1 Installation variables

    Additionally, there are also variables that don't relate to a particular package, but to the
    Qt installation itself.

   \table
        \header
            \li Variable
            \li Description
        \row
            \li \c QT_VISIBILITY_AVAILABLE
            \li On Unix, a boolean that describes whether Qt libraries and plugins were compiled
                with \c{-fvisibility=hidden}. This means that only selected symbols are exported.
        \row
            \li \c QT_LIBINFIX
            \li A string that holds the infix used in library names, when Qt is configured with
                \c{-libinfix}.
    \endtable
